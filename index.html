        <h2>Overview of the Microplastics Project</h2>
        <p>Microplastics, defined as plastic particles smaller than 5mm, have become a growing environmental concern. These particles are found in oceans, rivers, soils, and even in the food we consume. This project aims to uncover the sources of microplastics, their impact on biodiversity, and the contamination of food items.</p>

                <h3>Microplastic Sources</h3>
                <p>Microplastics originate from various sources, including plastic waste, industrial activities, and agricultural runoff. The accumulation of microplastics poses significant challenges to human health and biodiversity.</p>

                <h3>Contamination in Food</h3>
                <p>Studies have shown that microplastics are found in various food items such as seafood, salt, and even tap water. The ingestion of these particles could potentially lead to health problems, ranging from toxicity to affecting digestive systems.</p>

            <div class="grid-item">
                <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
                <p>The impact of microplastics extends beyond human health. It affects aquatic life, soil health, and ecosystems, disrupting the balance of nature. By addressing these challenges, we hope to propose solutions to mitigate microplastic pollution.</p>
